# docker-python-anaconda
This is a repository of the Dockerfile used to create a dockerimage with anaconda.  
As this is my first attempt at creating such a docker image, it is very basic
and simple

This starts a process to run a jupyter lab on port 1996 with notebooks being saved
in /opt/notebooks

Additional steps to add to this in the future are:
- install the latest version of anaconda (instead of a fixed version).
- install the following additional packages
  - NONE (for now).
